# ECE_366_Project_2
Welcome to project 2 where we are doing all things MIPS!

Meet out group members:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Nathan Sopt, UIN: 656988843

### Contributions for part a: 

Setup the gitHub environment / repository for project #2. Set up VSCode for use with MIPS assembly language. Created initial project   files and organized the layout for the project. Wrote amajor

Contributions for part b:

Wrote a majority of the code for part b, however testing and debugging was left for the other team members. Also cleaned up comments as well as restructured the readme to include progress from each progress report.

## Declan Hurless, UIN: 678190922

### Contributions for part a: 

Went through all previous lecture slides from the ECE 366 course to ensure proper MIPS instructions were used for the project. We wanted to ensure that we only used instructions that we covered in class.

Contributions for part b:

## Jesus Garcia, UIN: 650177551

### Contributions for part a:

Aided Declan in searching through the lecture slides. Upon finding all usable instructions, a rough list of possible MIPS instructions was made. Also created a really rough MIPS pseudo code layout for the complete program.

Contributions for part b:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ephren Manning, UIN: 668722451

### Contributions for part a:

Used the pseudo code layout created earlier to write the assembly code for the Fibonacci(n) program.

Contributions for part b:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**To compute Fibonacci(n):** Set the value of the word n to the desired n value for the computation. Assemble and run the program, the result will be stored in $t7.

**To compute the odd number (m):** Set the value of the word m to the desired value for the odd computation. Assemble and run the program, the result will be stored in $t4.
