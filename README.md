# ECE_366_Project_2
## Welcome to project 2 where we are doing all things MIPS!

## Meet out group members:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Nathan Sopt, UIN: 656988843

#### Contributions for part A: 

Setup the gitHub environment / repository for project #2. Set up VSCode for use with MIPS assembly language. 
Created initial project   files and organized the layout for the project. Wrote amajor

#### Contributions for part B:

Wrote a majority of the code for part b, however testing and debugging was left for the other team members. Also cleaned up comments as well as restructured the readme to include progress from each progress report.

#### Contributions for part C:

Verified code in MARS simulation software to make sure it operates normally.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Declan Hurless, UIN: 678190922

#### Contributions for part A: 

Went through all previous lecture slides from the ECE 366 course to ensure proper MIPS instructions were used for the project. 
We wanted to ensure that we only used instructions that we covered in class.

#### Contributions for part B:

Retrieved the most up-to-date code from the GitHub repository, copied it into the MARS software, and proceeded to run the code to make sure it performed as intended.

#### Contributions for part C:

Coded a majority of part c using the code from parts a and b.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Jesus Garcia, UIN: 650177551

#### Contributions for part A:

Aided Declan in searching through the lecture slides. Upon finding all usable instructions, a rough list of possible MIPS instructions was made. 
Also created a really rough MIPS pseudo code layout for the complete program.

#### Contributions for part B:

Aided in researching how to write the MIPS code for performing division via the subtraction method. Lecture slides were referenced.

#### Contributions for part C:

Assisted Declan in coding by discussing how to merge parts a and b and writing pseudo code.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Ephren Manning, UIN: 668722451

#### Contributions for part A:

Used the pseudo code layout created earlier to write the assembly code for the Fibonacci(n) program.

#### Contributions for part B:

Aided in researching how to write the MIPS code for performing division via the subtraction method. Lecture slides were referenced. 
Also downloaded the most up-to-date version of the code to verify the formatting and syntax was correct.

#### Contributions for part C:

Aided Nate in testing the code in MARS simulation software.

**To compute Fibonacci(n):** Set the value of the word n to the desired n value for the computation. Assemble and run the program, the result will be stored in $t7.

**To compute the odd number (m):** Set the value of the word m to the desired value for the odd computation. Assemble and run the program, the result will be stored in $t4.
